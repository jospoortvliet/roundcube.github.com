We proudly announce the release candidate for the next major version 1.6 of Roundcube webmail.

It includes a small number of improvements and fixes in comparison to the 1.6-beta release.

See the full changelog in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.6-rc) on the Github download page.

We believe it is production ready, but we recommend to test it on a separate environment. And don't forget to backup your data before installing it.

Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download#beta).
