This is the second service release to update the new stable version 1.6.
It provides a bunch of small fixes and improvements after getting your feedback
from the 1.6.0 and 1.6.1 release. See the full changelog in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.6.2) on the Github download page.

This release is considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations 
of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download).

Please do backup your data before updating!

## Upgrading the Complete Package

Attention when upgrading Roundcube using the complete package!

The installto.sh script does not update the `vendor` folder of the installation target.
If you're not using Composer to install plugins or other dependencies, please remove the `composer.json`
file of your Roundcube installation before running the `installto.sh` script.

If you have Composer installed, run `composer update --no-dev` to complete the upgrade.
