* Support responses (snippets) in HTML format
* Option to purge deleted mails older than 30, 60 or 90 days
* Unified and simplified services connection config options
* Removed the Classic and Larry skins from the release packages

See the full changelog in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.6.0)
on the Github download page.

## Breaking Changes to 1.5 and prior versions

The following config options have either been removed or renamed:

1. IMAP:
    - renamed `default_host` to `imap_host`
    - removed `default_port` option (non-standard port can be set via `imap_host`)
    - set "localhost:143" as a default for `imap_host`
2. SMTP:
    - renamed `smtp_server` to `smtp_host`
    - removed `smtp_port` option (non-standard port can be set via `smtp_host`)
    - set "localhost:587" as a default for `smtp_host`
3. LDAP:
    - removed `port` option from `ldap_public` array (non-standard port can be set via `host`)
    - removed `use_tls` option from `ldap_public` array (use tls:// prefix in `host`)
4. Managesieve:
    - removed `managesieve_port` option (non-standard port can be set via `managesieve_host`)
    - removed `managesieve_usetls` option (set tls:// prefix to `managesieve_host`)

The skins **Larry** and **Classic** are no longer part of the release packages.
If you used them in your deployment, you need to install them manually. That can easily be done via Composer:

```
$ composer require roundcube/larry
```

This release is considered stable and we encourage you to update your productive installations 
after carefully testing the upgrade scenario. Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download).

With the release of Roundcube 1.6.0, the previous stable release branches 1.5.x and 1.5.x will change into LTS low maintenance mode which means they will only receive important security updates. The 1.3.x series is no longer supported and maintained.
