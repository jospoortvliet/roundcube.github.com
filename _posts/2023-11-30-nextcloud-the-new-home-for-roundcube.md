We're happy to announce that the Roundcube project has found a new home with
[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com).

After Thomas, our founder and project lead, decided to step back, the Nextcloud project
project has now assumed ownership of the project organization and taken over the strategic,
operational and administrative responsibilities for Roundcube.

With its unwavering dedication to software freedom and data self-sovereignty, Nextcloud
will empower Roundcube, thereby enhancing development, fostering the growth of the
contributing community and in the longer term, exploring further possibilities for collaboration.

> I‘m proud and thankful for the many years with Roundcube and I'm now very happy to see
our project in good hands to remain a vital contributor for IT decentralization. – *Thomas Bruederli*
