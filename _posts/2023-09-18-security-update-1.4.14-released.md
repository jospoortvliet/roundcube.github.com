We just published a security update to the LTS version 1.4 of Roundcube Webmail.
It provides a fix to a recently reported XSS vulnerability:

- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in handling of linkrefs in plain text messages, reported by Niraj Shivtarkar.

See the full changelog in the release notes in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.4.14) on the Github download page.

We strongly recommend to update all productive installations of Roundcube 1.4.x with this new version.
